# Software Testing Tool

## What is Automation  Testing❓
 Automation Testing or Test Automation is a software testing technique that is performed using special automated testing software tools to execute a test case suite. In Automation testing, test data is entered into the System Under Test to compare expected and actual results for generating detailed test reports. It demands considerable investments of money and resources.

## What are Automation Testing Tools❗
 Automation Testing tools or Test Automation tools are software applications that help users to test various desktop, web, and mobile applications. These tools provide automation solutions in order to automate the testing process. Automated testing tools also offer multiple features for GUI testing, performance testing, load testing, and API testing.

### Factors you should consider while selecting a Test Automation Tool?
- Hardware and Software requirements of the automation tool. 
- Desired Platform support: Web, Desktop, Citrix, SAP, etc
- License cost if applicable 
- The cost involved in traning employees on tool
- Support and Update policy of the automation tool vendor.


**Some Testing tools are listed below**
- `Selenium `
- `Waiter`
- `Kobiton`
- `TestProject`
- `Eggplant`

## What is Selenium?
**Selenium** is a free (open-source) automated testing framework used to validate web applications across different browsers and platforms. You can use multiple programming languages like Java, C#, Python etc to create Selenium Test Scripts. Testing done using the Selenium testing tool is usually referred to as Selenium Testing.

Selenium Software is not just a single tool but a suite of software, each piece catering to different Selenium QA testing needs of an organization. Here is the list of tools

- Selenium Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
- Selenium Remote Control (RC)
- WebDriver
- Selenium Grid

## Why is selenium Used?
Selenium is basically used to automate the testing across various web browsers. It supports various browsers like Chrome, Mozilla, Firefox, Safari, and IE, and you can very easily automate browser testing across these browsers using Selenium WebDriver.

You can see live automated tests being performed on your computer screen. But the question that we’ll be answering in this article still stands as there are many tools available for automation testing.

## Why to chosse Selenium?
 1. **Language and Framework Support**

When someone chooses a tool the first thing that comes to mind is: "Does my tool supports the language that I know?"

Well, this is not the case with Selenium as it supports all major languages like Java, Python, JavaScript, C#, Ruby, and Perl programming languages for software test automation.

You can write your scripts in any of these programming languages and Selenium converts it into Selenium compatible codes in no time. So, there is no need for knowing Selenium only languages. Also, every Selenium supported language has dedicated frameworks which help in writing test script for Selenium test automation. So, when you go for Selenium as a tool for performing automation testing, you don’t have to worry about language and framework support as Selenium does that for you!


 2. **Open Source Availability**

    The Selenium community is continuously helping developers and software engineers in automating the web browser features and functionalities. Selenium being open source also helps you customize the code for better code management and enhance the functionality of predefined functions and classes. Selenium has become the most reliable web automation tool because of the ease of generating test scripts to validate functionality.

 3.  **Multi-Browser Support**

      “One Selenium script for all browsers” is what Selenium community have been working on and improvising every day. As per StatCounter, Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer, Opera, and Edge browsers are the most used browsers worldwide and Selenium script is compatible with all the mentioned browsers. You don’t need to rewrite scripts for every browser, just one script for all browsers.

 4. **Flexibility** 

    Test management is what which is very important in testing lifecycle. It becomes easier and more efficient with Selenium features like regrouping and refactoring of test cases. This helps developers and testers in quick changes to the code, reducing duplication, minimizing complications and improving maintainability. These features make Selenium more flexible and usable as compared to other automation testing tools and hence helps Selenium to keep an edge.

 5. **Parallel Test Execution and Faster Go-to-Market**

    The main aim of automated testing is to save time and efforts. With the help of Selenium Grid, we can execute multiple tests in parallel, hence reducing the test execution time. With the help of cloud-grids for cross-browser testing you can test across as many as hundreds of browsers in parallel using Selenium hence saving you time in multiples of hundreds.
